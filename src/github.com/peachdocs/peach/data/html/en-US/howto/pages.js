document.write("<h1>Add Single Pages</h1>\n\n<p>We understand the needs of showing pages as part of website other than the part of documentation, so Peach also supports to specify what files should be treated as single pages.</p>\n\n<p>In your <code>TOC.ini</code> file, add a section named <code>[pages]</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ini\">[pages]\n-: donate\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then you should put file(s) is(are) named <code>donate.md</code> under root directory of every supported language.</p>\n\n<p>For example, you support <code>en-US</code> and <code>zh-CN</code>, then you should have two following files:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>/en-US/donate.md</code></li>\n<li><code>/zh-CN/donate.md</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, the <strong>rule of default language</strong> will also apply that if you only have this file in default language version, the content of default language version will be presented when user&rsquo;s preferred language is not default language.</p>\n\n<p>The URL path to access this page, will then be <code>/donate</code>, which is same as file name without <code>.md</code> extension.</p>\n\n<p>Last but not the least, you can have as many as single pages you want, just define them in the <code>TOC.ini</code> file.</p>\n")
